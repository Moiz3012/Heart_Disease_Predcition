# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction

### 🧠 Machine Learning | Logistic Regression | Web App

This project predicts whether a person is at risk of **Heart Disease** based on key medical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, and more.  
It uses a **Logistic Regression Model** trained on a dataset where all features are binary (0 or 1) or numerical.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Logistic Regression model for binary prediction (Heart Disease / No Heart Disease)
- 🌐 Interactive Web Interface (HTML, CSS, Flask)
- 📊 Visualized training data and prediction results
- ⚡ Deployed-ready structure
- 💾 GitHub integration for open access

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input patient details like:
   - **Age**
   - **Cholesterol Level**
   - **Blood Pressure**
   - **Heart Rate**
   - **Chest Pain Type**
   - etc.
2. The model processes the input through logistic regression.
3. Outputs:
   - **Heart Disease Probability (%)**
   - **Prediction** → “Heart Disease” or “No Heart Disease”
